# ML_Algorithm_from_scratch

I tried to implement by myself a couple of ML algorithm. The code is commented, but I'm open to any question!

### K-means Clustering

K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.

Similarity of two points is determined by the distance between them.

There are a lot of ways to measure distance such as cosine similarity, average distance and so on. The similarity measure is at the core of k-means clustering. Optimal method depends on the type of problem. So it is important to have a good domain knowledge in order to choose the best measurement type.

K-means clustering tries to minimize distances within a cluster and maximize the distance between different clusters.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a way to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables using a straight line.

Linear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:

Linear regression models try to make the vertical distance between the line and the data points (that is, the residuals) as small as possible. This is called "fitting the line to the data." Often, linear regression models try to minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals (least squares), but other ways of fitting exist.
